# Citi-Bike-Analysis

Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit the northeastern part of the United States in March of 2020, I wanted to analyze the impact it had on Citi Bike.  
Since this project was done in June of 2020, I decided to compare data from January through May 2019 and January through May 2020.  The data used
can be found here:  https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html
  
Because of the pandemic, Citi Bike provided the first responder, healthcare and transit workforce with a free month of Citi Bike membership.
This resulted in over 20,000 free memberships for critical workers.  They provided vallet resources at stations directly adjacent to hospitals, 
were disinfecting bikes and transport vehicles and encouraging the use of PPE.  I was curious how all of this would impact their ridership.

During January - May 2019, there was a total of 131,038 riders and during the same time period in 2020, there were 101,046 riders.
This is a 23% decrease. The 'Citi Bike Rentals' dashboard shows the ridership comparison month-to-month for the 2 years.  Janaury and February 2020
show an increase over 2019, but it is easy to see the drop in ridership in March - May.  Despite giving away 20,000 free subscriptions, the drop in
subscriber riders is very evident.  (78% decrease).  Business temporarily closed and stay-at-home orders were issued for much of March and all of April.
As expected, the top 10 starting and ending stations remained the same (due to their location) while the ridership decreased overall.

The 'Age Gender Analysis' dashboard illustrates age, gender and trip duration seemed to remain relatively constant in 2019 and 2020.  The 30-somethings are the ones 
riding the most.  Males represented 73% of the riders in 2019 compared to 64% in 2020.  Females represented 20% of the riders in 2019 and 24% in 2020.  Since certain
clothes, shoes and hair styles aren't very conducive to riding a bike, I would expect less female riders compared to male riders. The 'other' category did 
increase from 5% in 2019 to 10% in 2020.  Those in their 20's and those in their 50's seem to take longer rides.  

Looking at the map,  Grove St PATH (due to it's proximity to the subway) and Hamilton Park (a popular historic area) are the top 2 stations.  The Sip Avenue 
station also sees a lot of traffic.  These stations should receive high priority regarding bike availability and maintenance.  Closer evaluation should be done 
to determine the reasons for those stations with very few riders.  It is possible that improvements are needed or it could be necessary to close some of thoses
stations.
